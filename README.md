The code receives a 3 column csv file. Where the first contains the key, the second the messages to be processed and the third the task to be performed.(All in capital letters)
For this exam, the decryption and encryption logic was the same, so if you want to change it, it is commented in the code where it should be.
The program returns the same csv file with a new column where the processed messages go.
